# Lab 3: Thunderbird Turn Signal

VHDL for ECE 281 [Lab 3](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/lab/lab3.html)

Targeted toward Digilent Basys3. Make sure to install the [board files](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore/tree/2018.2/boards/Digilent/basys3).

Tested on Windows 11.

## Build the project

You can simply open `thunderbird.xpr` and Vivado will do the rest!

## GitHub Actions Testbench

The workflow uses the [setup-ghdl-ci](https://github.com/ghdl/setup-ghdl-ci) GitHub action
to run a *nightly* build of [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/).

The workflow uses GHDL to analyze, elaborate, and run the entity specified in the `.github/workflows/testbench.yml`.

```yaml
env:
  TESTBENCH_ENTITY: myfile
```

If successful then GHDL will quietly exit with a `0` code.
If any of the `assert` statements fail **with** `severity error` then GHDL will cease the simulation and exit with non-zero code; this will also cause the workflow to fail.

## Documentation
C3C Jack Rust helped me find the constant to set my clock speed by explaining to me the reasoning he used to find the correct clock speed. (topbasys3.vhd, line 127)
